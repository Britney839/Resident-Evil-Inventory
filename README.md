# Resident-Evil-Inventory

This is a shortly-worked on Flask project based on the Flask framework! It involves utilizing Jinja2 templates/conditionals to create a working inventory with security validations. Involves uses of Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript and HTML!


TO RUN THIS PROJECT:

- Clone the repository in PyCharm (if you so wish) and go to run "app.py" by clicking the run button.
- Ensure Flask is usable and installed to pull this environment and render the code. Ensure flask is ALSO installed, by doing "pip install flask" and the requirements.txt "pip install -r requirements.txt" to ensure the app uses all of the packages.
- You will be directed to a welcome page which all webpages rely on the styling for "base.html" with flashing green text that says the user has "ACCESS" to the Satchel Inventory!!
- Each session is separated by unique user_ids, so the inventory will not be saved as it creates a new one everytime you run the website. 
- There's a Navbar that will enable you to click on the homepage for redirection, or navigate to "Add Items" or "Inventory" (add will direct you to a form, inventory will allow you to view what items you currently have!)
- You can remove items in the inventory as you add them, as there will be an individual button alongside each to interpret which items you are singularly removing.
- Additionally, for adding items that for a user that's new to the Resident Evil franchise, they can view under the category "See Collectibles List" to see what items within the games they can directly add to their own inventory.
- The system will indicate if an item from the Collectibles List has already been added, and will not let you re-add it unless you remove it.
