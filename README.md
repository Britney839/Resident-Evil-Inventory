# Resident-Evil-Inventory

This is a shortly-worked on Flask project based on the Flask framework! It involves utilizing Jinja2 templates/conditionals to create a working inventory with security validations. Involves uses of Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript and HTML!


TO RUN THIS PROJECT:

- Clone the repository in PyCharm and go to run "app.py" by clicking the run button OR by typing "flask run" in the local terminal.
- Ensure Flask is usable and installed to pull this environment and render the code.
- You will be directed to a welcome page which all webpages rely on the styling for "base.html"
- There's a Navbar that will enable you to click on the homepage for redirection, or navigate to "Add Items" or "Inventory" (add will direct you to a form, inventory will allow you to view what items you currently have!)
- You can remove items in the inventory as you add them, as there will be an individual button alongside each to interpret which items you are singularly removing.
